DESCRIPTION

This is an object-oriented module to convert dates into the Shire
Calender as presented in the Lord of the Rings by J. R. R. Tolkien. It
includes converting epoch time to the Shire Calendar (you can also get
epoch time back), comparison operators, and a method to print a
formatted string containing that does something to the effect of on this
date in history -- pulling events from the Lord of the Rings.

The biggest use I can see in this thing is in a startup script or
possible to keep yourself entertained in an otherwise boring app that
includes a date. If you have any other ideas/suggestions/uses, etc.,
please let me know. I am curious to see how this gets used (if it gets
used that is).

INSTALLATION

This pure-Perl module is installable using any of the usual
incantations.
