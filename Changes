    Fixed the spelling of "tree" in the events for 6 Astron.  Thanks to
    WYANT for this.

    The tireless folks of the cpan testers discovered that the test code
    doesn't work on windows.  I forgot to allow for the differences in
    epoch time between the two.   This again points to the need to use
    something other than epoch time (hopefully the new DateTime.pm
    stuff), but for now I've just adjusted the test code.

    A couple minor fixes here, one thanks to Robert Sim.  A couple of
    events in the month of Solmath were being reported on incorrect
    dates.

1.10		2002-07-14	Tom Braun
    Fixed 2 bugs in reporting, both from Rene Uittenbogaard.
	- First, Shire years should always start on Sterday, a fact
	  which I missed before.
	- Secondly, holidays are reporting in the books as 2 Lithe or 1
	  Yule, not as Yule 1 or Lithe 2.

1.01		2001-11-05	Tom Braun
    Fixed a minor bug in calculations, but it should have no if you're
    using this on dates in the unix epoch time range.  Thanks to Rick
    Osborne for spotting this.

1.00		2001-05-16	Tom Braun
    I have finally got around to making it work correctly (as I define
    correct anyway) for any year, instead of just those near the year
    2000.  While almost.  It's still limited by Epoch time to years
    between 1902 and 2037 (on my system anyway).  I'm planning on making
    this work with ICAL or Julian Days at some point -- which will
    really fix this problem.  I have also had it in CPAN for a few
    months without any bugs being reported.  Thus I am bumping up the
    version to 1.00 to signify a stable, non-development release, though
    for most things you wouln't notice any difference from version 0.11

0.11		2001-03-22	Tom Braun
    Added as_string and used it to overload the "" operator.  Thanks to
    Michael Schwern for this idea.

    Also, the code Michael sent me got me thinking about the order dates
    were displayed in, and after some thought I decided to change it to
    day then month. This is a really minor change, but it there.

    Year calculation has been redone to better match Tolkien's.  This
    should only break compatibility if you were storing Shire dates to
    disk somewhere.

    Some minor changes to the POD to make it format prettier

0.02		2001-02-19	Tom Braun
